        <h3>Project Description:</h3>
        <p>
            This project leverages a dataset of employees from a Spanish company to develop an application powered by a Machine Learning model. Its purpose is to predict the probability of an employee leaving, enabling the company to take preventive measures and reduce the economic losses associated with employee turnover.
        </p>

        <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The project addresses a supervised Machine Learning classification problem.</li>
            <li>Grid Search was used to compare multiple algorithms with different hyperparameter configurations.</li>
            <li>The best-performing model was a Random Forest, achieving an AUC metric of 79%, standing out for its predictive capability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenge:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Addressing data quality issues, ensuring consistency, and handling missing or corrupted data to ensure the models are trained on reliable data.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Analyzing the dataset to understand the underlying patterns, distributions, and relationships between features, which helped in selecting the right models and preprocessing techniques.</li>
        </ul>
